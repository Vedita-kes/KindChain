## About the Project
KindChain is a blockchain-based project that allows users to send appreciation messages securely on the blockchain.  
The project demonstrates the use of decentralized technology to promote transparency and positive communication.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to:  
- Write and compile a Solidity smart contract (KindChain.sol)  
- Connect Remix IDE with MetaMask  
- Deploy contracts on the Core t2 Testnet using test tokens  
- Verify and interact with smart contracts on the blockchain

## Final Note
Working on KindChain helped me understand how blockchain, smart contracts, and Web3 tools work together in real-world scenarios.  
It was a valuable and hands-on learning experience made possible through the GoG–OGI program.
